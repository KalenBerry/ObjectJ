# ObjectJ
ImageJ plugin written by Norbert Vischer, main project located at https://github.com/norbertvischer/ObjectJ. 

During my PhD at MIT, one of the key projects I worked on needed to track the locations and prescence of synapses on neurons in our 3D image stacks. However, we needed a tool that would allow us to tag locations in these stacks and to assign them a type based on the prescence of different synaptic markers at those locations. 

I did market research to find tools that could help and of these, ObjectJ was the closest tool at the time. However, ObjectJ's development was geared towards analysis of objects in individual stacks or single time sessions. I needed to make modifications to the underlying code to enable the kinds of analysis I wanted to perform. 

I made these changes 6 years ago and built an an analysis system on top of them using ObjectJ's macro system. However, I have never published those alterations.

In this fork of ObjectJ, I am making those modifications again to the most recent version of ObjectJ to take advantage of Norbert's wonderful work over the past 6 years fixing bugs and adding new features.
